## Console game engine
The game engine is based on components (game objects) which have Init method, which is called on the instantiation of the object, Update method, which is called every 50 ms (tick) and Deinit method, which is called when game object is destroyed. Graphics are based on ASCII symbols, which can be painted so it allows to make ASCII sprites with different colors. Falsemario engine is a better version, so if you are interested in using it for your own projects, please check the Falsemario project.

## Space Invaders
Was made in a week. Space invaders clone and console game engine. The game itself includes several difficulties, a local highscores file and pretty much the game.

## Falsemario
Was made in hurry in 3 hours. A clone of the mario game. A platformer game with enemies, coins and kind of an level editor (just edit the level.bpm file to create a new one!). To win you have to go to the right corner of the level. You have 3 lives. To gain score you have to collect coins or kill enemies. To restart the game you need to restart the application.
